frederick warne & co\ \ printed and bound in great britain by\ william clowes limited beccles and london\ \ \ \ \ a story for norah\ \ \ \ this is a tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red\ squirrel and his name was nutkin\ \ he had a brother called twinkleberry and a great many cousins: they lived\ in a wood at the edge of a lake\ \ \ \ in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut\ bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree which is the\ house of an owl who is called old brown\ \ \ \ one autumn when the nuts were ripe and the leaves on the hazel bushes\ were golden and green--nutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little\ squirrels came out of the wood and down to the edge of the lake\ \ \ \ they made little rafts out of twigs and they paddled away over the water\ to owl island to gather nuts\ \ each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar and spread out his tail\ for a sail\ \ \ \ they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for\ old brown and put them down upon his door-step\ \ then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow and\ said politely--\ \ old mr brown will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon\ your island?\ \ \ \ but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners he bobbed up and\ down like a little red cherry singing--\ \     riddle me riddle me rot-tot-tote!\      a little wee man in a red red coat!\      a staff in his hand and a stone in his throat;\      if you'll tell me this riddle i'll give you a groat\ \ now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr brown paid no attention\ whatever to nutkin\ \ he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep\ \ \ \ the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts and sailed away home in\ the evening\ \ \ \ but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry\ and the others brought a fine fat mole and laid it on the stone in front\ of old brown's doorway and said--\ \ mr brown will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather\ some more nuts?\ \ \ \ but nutkin who had no respect began to dance up and down tickling old\ mr brown with a nettle and singing--\ \     old mr b! riddle-me-ree!\      hitty pitty within the wall\      hitty pitty without the wall;\      if you touch hitty pitty\      hitty pitty will bite you!\ \ mr brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house\ \ \ \ he shut the door in nutkin's face presently a little thread of blue\ smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree and nutkin\ peeped through the key-hole and sang--\ \     a house full a hole full!\      and you cannot gather a bowl-full!\ \ \ \ \ \ the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their\ little sacks\ \ but nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a\ beech-stump playing marbles and watching the door of old mr brown\ \ \ \ on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they\ caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown\ \ they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl\ island\ \ \ \ twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but\ nutkin who had no nice manners brought no present at all he ran in\ front singing--\ \     the man in the wilderness said to me\     'how many strawberries grow in the sea?'\      i answered him as i thought good--\      'as many red herrings as grow in the wood'\ \ but old mr brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer\ was provided for him\ \ \ \ on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles\ which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown each beetle\ was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf fastened with a pine-needle pin\ \ but nutkin sang as rudely as ever--\ \      old mr b! riddle-me-ree\       flour of england fruit of spain\       met together in a shower of rain;\       put in a bag tied round with a string\     if you'll tell me this riddle i'll give you a ring!\ \ \ which was ridiculous of nutkin because he had not got any ring to give to\ old brown\ \ \ \ the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin\ gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush and stuck them full of\ pine-needle pins\ \ \ \ on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so\ sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon\ the stone they had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty\ top of the hill\ \ but nutkin skipped up and down singing--\ \     hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! hum-a-bum buzz!\       as i went over tipple-tine\       i met a flock of bonny swine;\     some yellow-nacked some yellow backed!\       they were the very bonniest swine\       that e'er went over tipple-tine\ \ \ \ old mr brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin\ \ but he ate up the honey!\ \ \ \ the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts\ \ but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock and played ninepins with a crab apple\ and green fir-cones\ \ \ \ on the sixth day which was saturday the squirrels came again for the\ last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last\ parting present for old brown\ \ but nutkin ran in front laughing and shouting--\ \     humpty dumpty lies in the beck\      with a white counterpane round his neck\      forty doctors and forty wrights\      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights!\ \ \ \ now old mr brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it\ again but still he did not speak\ \ \ \ nutkin became more and more impertinent--\ \       old mr b! old mr b!\     hickamore hackamore on the king's kitchen door;\     all the king's horses and all the king's men\     couldn't drive hickamore hackamore\     off the king's kitchen door\ \ nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still old brown said\ nothing at all\ \ \ \ nutkin began again--\ \     arthur o'bower has broken his band\      he comes roaring up the land!\      the king of scots with all his power\      cannot turn arthur of the bower!\ \ nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind and he took a\ running jump right onto the head of old brown!\ \ then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud\ squeak!\ \ the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes\ \ \ \ when they came back very cautiously peeping round the tree--there was old\ brown sitting on his door-step quite still with his eyes closed as if\ nothing had happened\ \                                    \ \ but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!\ \ \ \ this looks like the end of the story; but it isn't\ \ \ \ old brown carried nutkin into his house and held him up by the tail\ intending to skin him; but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke\ in two and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic\ window\ \ \ \ and to this day if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle he\ will throw sticks at you and stamp his feet and scold and shout--\ \ cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!\ \ \ the end\ \ \ \ \ \ end of project gutenberg's the
